## ES143 Final Project
*Yeabsira Mohammed, Grayson Martin, Jingfei Huang, Grace Mai*

## Overview
This project explores and implements the Structure from Motion (SfM) process. We deconstruct the SFM algorithm into manageable stages, each with detailed mathematical foundations and practical implementations.
### Instructions
- If running locally, please make sure all of the necessary packages are installed.
- This version is working with the public dataset acquired online  (fountain-p11) and a custom dataset that we acquired ourselves. Feel free to navigate to datasets to look at the custom datasets our team collected. 
- **colab_for_customDS** is where you can run SFM and bundle adjustment on our custom dataset
- **colab_for_fountainDS** is where you can run SFM and bundle adjustment on the fountain dataset
 - **helpers.py** is where we keep all the functions(AND MORE) that make the above two files possible.
 - **camera_calibration.ipynb** is where we calibrate.


## A poem by chatGPT 
OpenCV, in scenes both wild and tame,
Lends its tools to the SfM game.
From points to poses, it leads the way,
Turning night-time shots to 3D day.
